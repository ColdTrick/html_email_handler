File attachements notes and documentation
-----------------------------------------

File attachments support : 

If you wish to add file attachments to email notifications, you can use the notify_user function and pass it an "attachments" key, with ```$params['attachments']``` :
```php
	$attachments[] = array(
		'content' => $file_content, // File content
		//'filepath' => $file_content, // Alternate file path for file content retrieval
		'filename' => $file_content, // Attachment file name
		'mimetype' => $file_content, // MIME type of attachment
	);
```
Note that ```$attachments``` is an array, so you can pass several files at once, each with a custom filename and MIME type.

**Warning**: don't use 'filepath' setting on a production site (not functional yet)
